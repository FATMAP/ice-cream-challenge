## Ice cream challenge

You have been provided with some rough wireframes and a simple API.

With these, you'll create a simple app for the user to:

1. Arrive on the landing screen
2. Enter text to see relevant results
3. Tap on one of the results to go to details view

##### Wireframes

The designs are imperfect wireframes, so feel free to polish them at will and fill in any blanks

##### API

The API can be run locally by running the `api` script in the [package.json](/package.json). 
It serves via [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

##### Constraints

Tech wise there are no guidelines or constraints other than that it needs to be a React app we can run locally
